To get started I had to first do the following:

1)Install the coverage package
pip install coverage

2) Make sure that my files are in the same directory

3) Set up a unit test file

4) run a coverage test from the command line. This will generate a coverage report called explanation
coverage run your_test_file_name

5) run a coverage report in the command line to eyeball your code coverage
coverage report

6) run a coverage report in html to view what lines were not covered by your test file
coverage html
